# Forecasting and Analyzing Samsung Stock Trends�

This project uses time series analysis and volatility modeling to explore trends in Samsung's stock price — a company that not only drives innovation in tech, but also represents a significant portion of South Korea's economy.

As a Korean, I’ve seen firsthand the influence Samsung has on national sentiment and economic performance. This analysis combines data science techniques with financial market understanding to extract meaningful insights from over 20 years of stock data.
